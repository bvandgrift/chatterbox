Feature: Sending email

  As a Chatterbox user
  I want to send emails using the same options as any other service
  So that I can deliver notifications over email
  
  Scenario: Simple email sending
    Given a simple class wired to send email
       And some other condition to meet
     When some action by the actor
       And some other action
       And yet another action
     Then some testable outcome is achieved
       And something else we can check happens too
